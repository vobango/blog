      <h2>What is context switching anyway?</h2>
      <p>
        Have you ever had days where you had to juggle between multiple
        projects? No? Well, lucky you I guess but most developers probably know
        what I'm talking about. If you haven't been in this kind of situation
        here's what I mean - you're working on project A and then client B calls
        and says there's something that needs fixing/improving urgently. You put
        project A on hold and start working on project B. Just as you're
        finishing up the fixes for project B a pull request comes in and you
        think "Well, I was done with this project anyway, might as well take a
        look before going back to A." But turns out there are tons of changes in
        the PR so you take an hour to go through all of them. After that's done
        you can go back to working on project A but only for an awkward 45
        minutes because a meeting is coming up. Even though that was only a
        couple of context switches it can easily feel like you went back and
        forth between things all the time (and yet got nothing significant
        done!). If this is a one-of kind of a workday then yeah it sucks but if
        you have to work like this for continuously for a longer period of time
        the it can easily lead to burnout or worse. So what can you do to avoid
        going insane?
      </p>

      <h2>Avoid context switching</h2>
      <p>
        A solid way to avoid mental fatigue from context switching is to not
        contstantly switch contexts (wow, thanks Einstein!) but how do you do
        that? Here are a couple of practical tips and tricks:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Turn off all notifications and only check them at a fixed time every
          day (e.g at the start of your workday, after lunch and before
          finishing up fo the day). This includes Slack, Skype, e-mail and phone
          notifications. On one hand this gives you large chunks of
          uninterrupted work time and on the other hand if anyone needs you to
          work on something urgent you can get to that in a timely manner.
        </li>
        <li>
          Postpone "urgent" things. By this I mean sometimes a client or a
          coworker comes to you with a task they claim is absolutlely critical
          and needs to be done ASAP. If you find yourself in this kind of a
          situation then be extremely sceptical of the urgency of the task and
          see if it can be postponed until your regular "context switching time"
          (after lunch etc) or if it's a longer task then maybe even until the
          next day. Bonus: use this tactic for pull requests also.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you have to work on multiple projects concurrently and there's no
          rush with any of them then work on a single project on any given day
          and switch projects daily.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>When context switching is unavoidable</h2>
      <p>
        Sometimes the tricks above don't work and you really have to switch
        between multiple things a day OR when you feel mental fatigue even after
        avoiding switching as much as possible. Then what?
      </p>
      <h3 class="highlight">Meditate</h3>
      <p>
        Uuuhh...what? Ok, hear me out. If you've been to a perfume shop you
        might've seen a jar of coffee beans next to the perfumes. It's there so
        you can smell the beans between trying different perfumes to "reset"
        your sense of smell (or as they say, cleanse your palette). Meditating
        between projects has the same effect but for your brain. But how does it
        work? Similarily to the smell of coffee being almost a complete opposite
        of a regular perfume (and thus providing massive contrast between
        smells), meditating is the polar opposite of working on a (software)
        project and thus gives your monkey brain<sup>[1]</sup> time to
        "cleanse". At this point you may be asking what kind of medidation am I
        thinking of and for how long? I suggest practicing the easiest
        meditation there is - concentrate on your breathing. Just be aware of
        your breathing and if your mind starts wandering around then try to
        notice it and re-focus on the breathing. As for the duration it's up to
        you but I suggest starting at 10 minutes. This might seem like a while
        and a pretty significant amount of time if you meditate between every
        project but this has a couple of benefits:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Your mind is refreshed and clearer when starting work on the new
          project which might mean you can complete the task quicker than you
          would've completed it without meditating so there's less or no loss in
          time altogether.
        </li>
        <li>
          Even if meditating decreases the time you have every day to work on
          projects it can definately enable frequent context switching for
          longer periods of time.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If meditating is <em>really</em> not your thing then a great alternative
        is going for a short walk or a bicycle ride or doing a short workout.
        Notice how all of these activities are physical (or at least kind of
        physical in the case of meditation as you're not moving much but still
        concentrating on a physical thing - breathing). This is intentional as
        it creates the necessary contrast between projects which are all mental
        work. That's why it's not a good idea to try to refresh your brain
        between projects by browsing the internet or playing video games. You're
        still engaging in a mental activity and thus exhausting your mental
        resources.
